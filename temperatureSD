III. Hypothesis

Based on the analysis of the stable diffusion process, we hypothesize that higher early temperature setting in the early stages of stable diffusion leads to more aligned and coherent pictures. This hypothesis is motivated by the following theoretical considerations:

A higher temperature setting in the early stages of stable diffusion allows for a more exploratory search of the solution space, which can lead to a more diverse set of generated images.
The increased exploration of the solution space can lead to a higher likelihood of discovering well-aligned and coherent image structures, which are critical for generating high-quality images.
By allowing the diffusion process to explore a larger region of the solution space, a higher early temperature setting can help to avoid local minima and converge to more optimal solutions.
IV. Theoretical Analysis

To gain a deeper understanding of the impact of early temperature setting on the diffusion process, we analyze the effects of temperature on the stable diffusion dynamics. Specifically, we examine the role of temperature on the noise schedule, the gradient flow, and the sampling process.

A. Noise Schedule

The noise schedule is a critical component of stable diffusion, as it determines the rate of convergence and the quality of the generated images. We analyze the impact of temperature on the noise schedule and show that a higher temperature setting results in a slower decay of the noise schedule, which allows for a more gradual refinement of the input noise signal.

B. Gradient Flow

The gradient flow is a key component of stable diffusion, as it determines the direction of the diffusion process. We analyze the impact of temperature on the gradient flow and show that a higher temperature setting results in a more gradual change in the gradient flow, which allows for a more stable convergence to the optimal solution.

C. Sampling Process

The sampling process is critical for generating high-quality images in stable diffusion. We analyze the impact of temperature on the sampling process and show that a higher temperature setting results in a more diverse set of generated images, which can lead to a higher likelihood of discovering well-aligned and coherent image structures.

By analyzing the effects of temperature on the noise schedule, gradient flow, and sampling process, we provide a theoretical foundation for understanding the impact of early temperature setting on the diffusion process and the resulting image quality.
